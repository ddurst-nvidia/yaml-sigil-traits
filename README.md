`yaml-sigil-traits` defines the shared Rust traits and data types for
[`yaml-sigil`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-spec#tldr) signing,
transcription, and verification.

Use this crate when callers and implementations need a stable in-process API.
The specification defines document and signature behavior. This crate defines
the Rust trait shapes, request and response data, capabilities, errors, and
helper functions exposed by those traits.

## Contract surface

This crate exposes the portable contract for these API areas.

| API | Sync trait | Async trait | Capability DTO |
|-----|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Signing | `Signer`, `SignerWithRng` | `AsyncSigner`, `AsyncSignerWithRng` | `SignerCapabilities` |
| Transcription | `Transcriber` | `AsyncTranscriber` | `TranscriberCapabilities` |
| Verification | `Verifier` | `AsyncVerifier` | `VerifierCapabilities` |

`v1alpha1` defines no magic bytes, registered media type, or required file
extension. Callers select forms through `OutputForm`, `TranscriptionForm`, and
`ArtifactForm`.

The YAML decompose and verify APIs require complete artifacts because
last-marker selection requires EOF.

The modules group the contract by concern:

- `algorithm` defines `AlgorithmId` and the canonical YAML `alg` string mapping.
- `conformance` defines portable policy vocabulary for YAML signature documents,
  protobuf wire decoding, and outer-envelope conformance.
- `signing` defines signing request, outcome, error, capability, key, and output
  DTOs.
- `transcription` defines compose and decompose request, response, error,
  capability, artifact, and form DTOs.
- `verification` defines verification request support DTOs, verifier states,
  pre-verification DTOs, invocation errors, generic public-key DTOs, and
  options.

The crate does not provide default signing, transcription, or verification
implementations. Implementation crates own free-function APIs such as `sign`,
`compose`, and `verify`, default zero-sized types, YAML parsing, protobuf
decoding, cryptographic operations, trust-store behavior, and transport policy.

Signer and verifier implementations choose the concrete key types they accept.
The shared `SigningKey`, `SignRequest`, and `PublicKeys` data types borrow those
keys without constructing or parsing them.

## Trait usage

Use the synchronous traits through generic bounds or trait objects.

```rust
use yaml_sigil_traits::signing::{SignOutcome, SignRequest, Signer};

pub fn sign_with<S: Signer>(
    signer: &S,
    request: &SignRequest<'_, S::Ed25519SigningKey, S::P256SigningKey>,
) -> SignOutcome {
    signer.sign(request)
}
```

Use the async traits through generic bounds. The async traits use native
AFIT/RPITIT with explicit `+ Send` returned-future bounds and `Send + Sync`
super-bounds, so they are intentionally not object-safe.

```rust
use yaml_sigil_traits::verification::{
    ArtifactForm, AsyncVerifier, InvocationError, PublicKeys, VerifierOptions,
    VerifierState,
};

pub async fn verify_with<V: AsyncVerifier>(
    verifier: &V,
    artifact: &[u8],
    form: ArtifactForm,
    keys: &PublicKeys<'_, V::Ed25519VerifyingKey, V::P256VerifyingKey>,
) -> Result<VerifierState, InvocationError> {
    verifier
        .verify(artifact, form, keys, VerifierOptions::default())
        .await
}
```

`PublicKeys` carries caller-supplied verification keys indexed by algorithm.
The artifact's unsigned `keyid` remains a deployment-specific lookup hint.
Concrete implementation crates own key parsing and may narrow behavior, such
as requiring a configured trust store. Document those narrowings in the
implementation crate.

`SignerWithRng` is an object-safe companion to `Signer` for implementations
that accept caller-supplied cryptographic randomness. Its async counterpart,
`AsyncSignerWithRng`, requires a `Send` caller RNG and returns a `Send` future.
The crate re-exports `CryptoRngCore` so implementations and callers share the
same RNG trait version.

## Feature configuration

Default features enable `std`. Disable default features to use the complete
trait and DTO surface with `no_std + alloc`:

```toml
[dependencies]
yaml-sigil-traits = { version = "0.4.0-rc.1", default-features = false }
```

The application supplies its allocator and panic behavior. Async trait callers
also supply their executor. This crate defines the caller-RNG contract but does
not choose an entropy source or provide a signer implementation.

## Specification source

The normative `yaml-sigil` specification lives in
[`yaml-sigil-spec`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-spec). It is
maintenance input for reviewing this crate's public trait and DTO vocabulary.
Normal builds, docs.rs builds, and published crates do not require a local spec
checkout.

The submodule uses `update = none` so Cargo consumers of this Git repository do
not fetch specification material that is not build input. Initialize the pinned
specification explicitly when reviewing a specification update:

```shell
git -c submodule.source-spec.update=checkout \
  submodule update --init source-spec
```

Keep specification-pin updates scoped to this crate's public trait and DTO
contract. Do not add generated protobuf dependencies or coordinate downstream
implementation updates from this repository.

## Build and test

The development toolchain follows Rust `stable` through
`rust-toolchain.toml`. The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is Rust
`1.95.0`, as declared in `Cargo.toml`.

```shell
cargo xtask ci
cargo package
```

`cargo xtask ci` also checks Markdown, the standalone xtask workspace, and
dependency advisories. The GitHub Actions workflow runs the same validation as
independent steps. `cargo package` performs separate local package assembly and
verification without uploading anything; it is not part of the non-release CI
sequence.

## Publishing

Releases are published to
[`yaml-sigil-traits` on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-sigil-traits).
The manifest limits publication to the crates.io registry.

## Dependency boundary

`yaml-sigil-traits` stays independent from the rest of the `yaml-sigil` Rust
implementation and does not choose a cryptography library. Implementations
connect the generic signing and verification key slots to their concrete key
types through associated types.

## Third-party material

NVIDIA-authored crate material is licensed under Apache-2.0. The crate mirrors
standards-derived identifiers and public-key format behavior without
relicensing the cited standards material. Copyright, source, warranty,
patent/IP, and non-endorsement notices are collected in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-traits/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

The pinned specification has its own complete notice at
[`source-spec/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-spec/blob/0fa13f2bf7aac43afb492d9c7dad8e3bf9cfa2bc/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
The crate package excludes `source-spec/`; repository distributions that
initialize the submodule must preserve that notice.
